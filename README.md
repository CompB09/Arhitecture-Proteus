# Arhitecture Proteus

## Labs

* Project 1 
> The circuits from the binary logics (the good one); 3 ways of doing it

* Project 2
> We used ground so we can stabilize and do not get errors 

Project 3 - normal circuit with 3 inputs

Full Adder - changed all the gates with NAND for and then with NOR in the same project with the full adder
