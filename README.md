## Labs

* [Project 1](https://github.com/CompB09/Arhitecture-Proteus/blob/master/Project%201.pdsprj) 
> The circuits from the binary logics (the good one); 3 ways of doing it

* [Project 2](https://github.com/CompB09/Arhitecture-Proteus/blob/master/Project%202.pdsprj)
> We used ground so we can stabilize and do not get errors 

* [Project 3](https://github.com/CompB09/Arhitecture-Proteus/blob/master/Project%203.pdsprj)
> Normal circuit with 3 inputs

* [Full Adder](https://github.com/CompB09/Arhitecture-Proteus/blob/master/Full%20Adder.pdsprj)
> Changed all the gates with NAND for and then with NOR in the same project with the full adder
